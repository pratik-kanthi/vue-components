# vue_components

Vu[e9] is a UI kit to develop smart & scalable frontend applications. At E9, we want to create a solid foundation which allows a more collaborative approach to building interfaces. Enjoy the dev experience of model service, directives, re-usable components, layouts and customised tables in markdown, and develop applications in no time. Flexible across AngularJS and VueJS. Completely works in abstraction.
