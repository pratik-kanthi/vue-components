        <p>Stepper is a component that displays content as a process with defined by user milestones. Steps are separated and connected by buttons.
            This is a great solution for a variety of registration forms, where you don't want to scare the user with loads of fields and questions. Stepper can be aligned vertically as well as horizontally.</p>
